[HYP] helpdesk_redirect_to_managed_app
class: MISCONFIG
asset: help.desk.avatarux.com
confidence: 65
reasoning: HTTP 302 from help.desk subdomain suggests redirect to hosted helpdesk (Zendesk/Freshdesk/etc). If tenant is unclaimed or misconfigured, subdomain takeover possible.
evidence_needed: Follow redirect chain to determine target application and tenant status.
verify_steps: curl -sI https://help.desk.avatarux.com to capture Location header and response details.
impact: Subdomain takeover -> impersonate support portal -> phishing credential theft | severity=HIGH
testability: PASSIVE
[HYP] cpanel_exposed_admin
class: MISCONFIG
asset: cpanel.avatarux.com
confidence: 70
reasoning: cPanel hostname unprobed; if serving HTTP on standard ports, could expose hosting control panel without authentication.
evidence_needed: HTTP response from cpanel.avatarux.com to confirm service type and auth requirements.
verify_steps: curl -sI http://cpanel.avatarux.com and https://cpanel.avatarux.com
impact: Server compromise, data exfiltration, code execution | severity=CRITICAL
testability: PASSIVE
[HYP] webdav_calendar_misconfig
class: MISCONFIG
asset: cpcalendars.avatarux.com
confidence: 45
reasoning: HTTP 500 on cpcalendars/cpcontacts suggests misconfigured WebDAV or cPanel calendar service. May leak server info in error response.
evidence_needed: Full response headers and body from the 500 error to identify software/version.
verify_steps: curl -sv https://cpcalendars.avatarux.com to capture headers and error body.
impact: Information disclosure, potential file access if WebDAV exposed | severity=MEDIUM
testability: PASSIVE
[PARKED] webdav_calendar_misconfig: confidence 45 < 50 threshold; HTTP 500 on cPanel services often just disabled features, low exploitability.

[HYP] cpanel_subdomain_takeover
class: MISCONFIG
asset: cpanel.avatarux.com
confidence: 75
reasoning: Cloudflare error 1001 (DNS points to prohibited IP) indicates the subdomain is configured in Cloudflare DNS but origin server is not properly set up. IP resolves to 162.159.136.54 (Cloudflare edge). Classic subdomain takeover indicator.
evidence_needed: Verify if origin is truly abandoned; attempt CNAME takeover if Cloudflare zone deleted.
verify_steps: 1. Check if origin IP serves content. 2. Attempt to claim subdomain via Cloudflare if zone orphaned. 3. Verify no active service on origin.
impact: Full subdomain takeover → phishing, credential theft, XSS on *.avatarux.com | severity=CRITICAL

reasoning: JSM customer portal exposes tenant IDs, feature flags, and experiment configurations in page source HTML. Multiple tenant IDs visible in dynamic_configs JSON.
evidence_needed: Confirm tenant IDs can be used for enumeration or cross-tenant access.
verify_steps: 1. Extract all tenant IDs from page source. 2. Test if tenant IDs can be used in API calls. 3. Check for IDOR on tenant-scoped endpoints.

confidence: 58
reasoning: Affiliate portals typically expose affiliate_id in URLs, API calls, or local storage. If sequential or guessable, could allow cross-affiliate data access including commission details and personal information.
evidence_needed: Identify affiliate_id parameter in API calls; test sequential IDs for unauthorized data access.
verify_steps: 1. GET https://affiliates.betpanda.io/ - analyze page source and JS bundles. 2. Identify API endpoints with affiliate_id params. 3. Test IDOR on identified endpoints.

[HYP] betpanda_cable_unauth_realtime
class: MISCONFIG
asset: cable.betpanda.io
confidence: 45
reasoning: Custom Node service on BetPanda surface, publicly 200 with "BB CABLE 🔌" banner, live and Cloudflare-fronted. Websocket/cable services often mount channel/pubsub endpoints requiring auth; exposure of the service root with no auth gate is a real in-scope asset, but no non-root path is discoverable passively.
evidence_needed: Discover the actual realtime/websocket endpoint and confirm it exposes data or allows subscription without auth.
verify_steps: 1. GET https://cable.betpanda.io/ (banner, no auth). 2. POST/GET common mounts with JSON error to map router (done: /socket /ws /events -> 404). 3. Attempt WS upgrade on discovered path and observe auth response.
impact: Unauthorized access to realtime/notification/casino event streams if any channel is unauthenticated | severity=LOW-MEDIUM
testability: PASSIVE
[HYP] betpandacasino_spa_graphql_shadow
class: OTHER
asset: betpandacasino.io
confidence: 42
reasoning: /graphql/ and /api/ return 200 SPA shell (catch-all), meaning an SPA router shadows all paths; a real API/GraphQL could exist on a different path or backend not yet mapped. Casino is high-value (money flows). No api subdomain resolves so far.
evidence_needed: Find the real API base URL used by the casino/affiliate SPA (from JS bundle or DNS) and test for auth/IDOR on it.
verify_steps: 1. Fetch https://betpandacasino.io/ JS bundles, grep for api base URL/graphql URL. 2. Probe discovered base for /graphql and /api with GET introspection. 3. Only passive/read-only unless scoped API confirmed.
impact: Potential casino/affiliate API access if unauthenticated surface exists | severity=MEDIUM (unconfirmed)
testability: PASSIVE
[NEXT] PROBE: Fetch https://betpandacasino.io/ and https://affiliates.betpanda.io/ HTML, extract all JS bundle URLs, grep bundles for `https?://\S*api\S*` and `/graphql` to locate the real API base URL; then read-only GET that base + /graphql + /api/v1.
[RISK] AvatarUX Studios: 40 — propensity to hunt only perimeter/config misconfigs; top authentic leads (BetPanda cable WS service, SPA-shadowed API) remain unconfirmed with no credentialed access, so depth (real IDOR/AUTH breaks) is still blocked. No auth-bypass or mutating tests performed; passive GET/HEAD/OPTIONS + WS handshake only.

confidence: 65
reasoning: BetPanda affiliate portal is live Vite SPA with Cloudflare fronting. Affiliate portals typically expose affiliate IDs, commission data, and referral stats. If API endpoints are discoverable and lack authorization, IDOR on affiliate_id or referral_id parameters could leak commission data.
evidence_needed: Discover API subdomain (api.betpanda.io, affiliates-api.betpanda.io, etc.) and test for unauthenticated access to affiliate data.
verify_steps: 1. Try common API subdomains: api.betpanda.io, affiliates-api.betpanda.io, api.affiliates.betpanda.io. 2. If API found, test GET /api/affiliates/{id} or /api/referrals/{id} with incrementing IDs. 3. Check for Authorization header requirements.
