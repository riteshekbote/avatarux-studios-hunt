[CHANGED] `www.avatarux.com` CNAME → `secure.cloudways.cloud` (shared hosting edge), not direct AvatarUX infra
[NEW] Out-of-scope noise identified: alfaview (OpenAPI spec), BASF (Azure Functions), daimlertruck (locked), elringklinger — all unrelated to AvatarUX Studios program

[HYP] BetPanda Affiliate Portal IDOR/BOLA on Affiliate IDs
class: IDOR
asset: affiliates.betpanda.io
confidence: 65
reasoning: Vite SPA affiliate portal for in-scope brand BetPanda; affiliate systems typically use numeric/sequential affiliate_id or campaign_id in API calls; no API routes found in JS bundle suggests API is on separate subdomain or obfuscated
evidence_needed: API endpoint discovery via JS bundle analysis or network interception showing affiliate_id/campaign_id parameters; unauthorized access to other affiliates' stats/commissions/payouts
verify_steps: GET https://affiliates.betpanda.io/ (analyze JS bundles for API base URLs); GET https://api.betpanda.io/ or similar (passive DNS for API subdomains); if API found, test IDOR on /affiliates/{id}/stats, /campaigns/{id}/commissions with different affiliate IDs
impact: Cross-affiliate PII dump (email, payment details), commission theft, campaign manipulation — HIGH
testability: PASSIVE
[HYP] Atlassian Help Desk Information Disclosure / Anonymous Access
class: MISCONFIG
asset: help.desk.avatarux.com
confidence: 55
reasoning: Atlassian Edge (Jira Service Management/Confluence) at help.desk.avatarux.com [302]; public help desks often leak project names, issue types, component names, or allow anonymous issue creation/viewing; 302 suggests redirect to login or portal front
evidence_needed: Anonymous access to /servicedesk/customer/portal/, /rest/servicedeskapi/ endpoints, or Confluence spaces; enumeration of internal project keys, component names, or customer emails
verify_steps: GET https://help.desk.avatarux.com/ (follow 302); GET https://help.desk.avatarux.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/; GET https://help.desk.avatarux.com/rest/servicedeskapi/servicedesk; GET https://help.desk.avatarux.com/wiki/ (Confluence); check for unauthenticated REST API responses
impact: Internal project/infrastructure disclosure, customer ticket data exposure, AvatarUX employee enumeration — MEDIUM
testability: PASSIVE
[HYP] cPanel Hosting Control Panel Exposure / Credential Reuse
class: AUTH
asset: cpanel.avatarux.com
confidence: 45
reasoning: cPanel subdomain exists but unprobed (HTTP unprobed); cPanel on Cloudways shared hosting; if accessible, default/weak credentials or credential reuse from other breaches could grant hosting control; cPanel exposes file manager, databases, email accounts, SSL certs
evidence_needed: Live HTTP service on cpanel.avatarux.com:2083 (HTTPS) or :2082; login panel accessibility; version disclosure
verify_steps: GET https://cpanel.avatarux.com:2083/ (HEAD first); GET https://cpanel.avatarux.com:2082/; check for cPanel login page, version in headers/html; passive SSL cert check for cpanel.avatarux.com
impact: Full hosting compromise — file access, DB access, email takeover, subdomain takeover, SSL key theft — CRITICAL
testability: PASSIVE
[PARKED] cPanel Hosting Control Panel Exposure / Credential Reuse: confidence<50 (45), cpanel.avatarux.com unprobed — may not be live or may be Cloudways-managed with no direct access; verify_steps passive-only but need live confirmation first
[FINAL] 1. BetPanda Affiliate Portal IDOR/BOLA on Affiliate IDs (65)
[FINAL] 2. Atlassian Help Desk Information Disclosure / Anonymous Access (55)
[NEXT] PROBE: GET https://affiliates.betpanda.io/ — fetch main page + all referenced JS bundles (main.*.js, chunk.*.js) for API endpoint discovery; analyze for affiliate_id, campaign_id, user_id, apiBaseUrl, or GraphQL endpoints
[LEARN] REJECTED alfaview OpenAPI/IDOR @ apis.alfaview.com: out of scope (not AvatarUX Studios brand or infrastructure)
[LEARN] REJECTED BASF Azure Functions @ ap-digitalconnect.api.basf.com: out of scope
[LEARN] REJECTED daimlertruck/elringklinger: out of scope
[LEARN] ACCEPTED MISCONFIG @ help.desk.avatarux.com: Atlassian Edge confirmed, in-scope AvatarUX infrastructure
[LEARN] ACCEPTED IDOR @ affiliates.betpanda.io: in-scope brand (BetPanda) affiliate portal discovered
[RISK] avatarux-studios: 75 — High-value gaming brands (Roobet, Stake, Gamdom, BetPanda, RainBet) with undiscovered game/API infrastructure; discovered BetPanda affiliate portal shows brand assets exist and are testable; AvatarUX corporate infra (Atlassian, cPanel) exposes secondary risk; main game API attack surface likely large but unmapped
